# Time_series_analysis
Repository for data analysis and visualization of time series data

Time series data are everywhere from weather forecasting, signal processing, and heart rate monitoring to the stock market analysis, sales forecasting, and variable stars studying. Time series data represent any sequence of values collected at discrete, regular or irregular, time intervals.

#### 1. Time series analysis of Auckland rainfall data

This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks for analysis of Auckland rainfall data. I have decided to use an Auckland Council file, A64871M, covering 125 years between 1872 and 1997 because it contains long-term time-series data and therefore provides unique opportunities and challenges for the exploratory data analysis as well as for the statistical data analysis and modeling.

The goal of the project is to investigate whether the rainfall dataset is reliable and whether we can use it for time series data modeling. We are trying to answer a question about the accuracy of the predictions for short and long-term variations for this data set.
